# Weather-Based-Prediction-of-Wind-Turbine-Energy-Output
This project predicts wind turbine electricity output using weather data like wind speed, temperature, and pressure. A machine learning model learns from past data to estimate future power generation, helping improve energy planning, reduce wastage, and make renewable energy more reliable.
